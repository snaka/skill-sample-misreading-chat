## Customization / Next Steps

At this point, you should have a working copy of our Hello World skill. 

Normally, if you were buildling a skill from one of our templates, you would customize it and make it your own (as opposed to a clone of our template).  After that, you would certify and publish the skill.  Given that this is the Hello World skill, you won't be doing that.  Instead, check out some of these other templates which will start to show you more of the features of the Alexa Skills Kit.

* [Fact Skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) - the Fact skill is a simple example a great next step after Hello World.  The skill speaks facts to the user.
* [How To Skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto) - a skill where the user can ask for a given recipe or other response based on a look up value - a dictionary of sorts.  The sample provides Minecraft recipes, but you can customize it to provide whatever information you'd like.
* [Trivia Quiz Game](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia) - this skill asks the user a series of questions, tracks right and wrong answers and provides a score at the end of the game.
* [Fact w/In Skill Purchasing](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact-in-skill-purchases) - takes the Fact skill and adds in skill purchasing to it.
